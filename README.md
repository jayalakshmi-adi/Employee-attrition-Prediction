# **Predicting-Employee-Attrition**
# Objective
Using machine learning to predict employee attrition in Python

I perform turnover analysis project by using Pythonâ€™s Scikit-Learn library. We use Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine as classifier for employee attrition and measure the accuracy of models that are built.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains  18 columns and 49635 rows and has a mix of numerical and categorical features.

* EmployeeID           
* recorddate_key         
* birthdate_key       
* orighiredate_key       
* terminationdate_key    
* age                    
* length_of_service      
* city_name              
* department_name     
* job_title              
* store_name              
* gender_short           
* gender_full           
* termreason_desc        
* termtype_desc         
* STATUS_YEAR             
* STATUS              
* BUSINESS_UNIT  

# Results & Conclusion


Random Forest is the best classfier for predicting employee attrition for our dataset.
